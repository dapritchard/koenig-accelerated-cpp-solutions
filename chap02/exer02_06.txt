What does the following code do?

    int i = 0;
    while (i < 10) {
        i += 1;
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
    }

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code writes the numbers 1 through 10 one line at-a-time to stdout, and
flushing the buffer after each line.
