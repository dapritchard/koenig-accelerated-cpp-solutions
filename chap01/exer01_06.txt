What does the following program do if, when it asks you for input, you type two
names (for example, Samuel Beckett)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program uses the first word from the input for the first std::cin call, and
uses the second word from the input for the second std::cin call.  Thus the
output for the program is:

    What is your name?
    Hello, Samuel
    And what is yours? Hello, Beckett; nice to meet you too!
