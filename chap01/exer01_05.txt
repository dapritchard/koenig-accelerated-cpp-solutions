Is this program valid?  If so, what does it do?  If not, say why not, and
rewrite it to be valid.

    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>

    int main() {

        {
            std::string s = "a string";

            {
                std::string x = s + ", really";
                std::cout << s << std::endl;
            }

            std::cout << x << std::endl;
        }

        return 0;
    }

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It does not compile because x is not declared in the outer scope when it is
invoked the second time.  To fix it we can declare x in the outer scope or place the

    std::cout << x << std::endl;

line inside of the inner scope.
