Is the following program valid?  If so, what does it do?  If not, why not?

    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>

    int main() {
        {
            const std::string s = "a string";
            std::cout << s << std::endl;
        }

        {
            const std::string s = "another string";
            std::cout << s << std::endl;
        }

        return 0;
    }

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes the program is valid.  A const std::string variable named s is declared
twice in this code, but since declarations are in different scopes it is not a
problem.
