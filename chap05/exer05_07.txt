Given the implementation of frame in section 5.8.1 page 93, and the following
code fragment

    vector<string> v;
    frame(v);
    
describe what happens in this call.  In particular, trace through how both the
width function and the frame function operate.  Now, run this code.  If the
results differ from your expectations, first understand why your expectations
and the program differ, and then change one to match the other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since `v' has zero elements, the call to `width(z)' returns 0, and consequently
`frame(v)' simply returns:
