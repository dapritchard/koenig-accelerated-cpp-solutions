Look again at the driver functions you wrote in the previous exercise.  Note
that it is possible to write a driver that differs only in the declaration of
the type for the data structure that holds the input file.  If your vector and
list test drivers differ in any other way, rewrite them so that they differ only
in this declaration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program written for exercise 5-3, exer05_03.cpp, was written to satisfy this
requirement.  It does so by using preprocessor conditionals in
student_container.h to specify whether to use the list or the vector typedef.
The other change that needed to be done was to create a macro which calls the
appropriate sort function depending on the container type, which is also defined
in student_container.h.
