As we learned in section 4.1.4 page 58, it can be expensive to return (or pass)
a container by value.  Yet the median function that we wrote in section 8.1.1
page 140 passes the vector by value.  Could we rewrite the median function to
operate on iterators instead of passing the vector?  If we did so, what would
you expect the performance impact to be?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We certainly could rewrite the median function to take iterators as its
arguments rather than copying the entire data structure.  This would have the
same effect as passing the object by reference.  Doing so would save the
overhead of copying the structure, but performing the sort call during the
function would change the original data, which might not be desirable.
