In the binary_search function in section 8.2.6 page 148, why didn't we write

    (begin + end) / 2

instead of the more complicated

    begin + (end - begin) / 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The result of `begin + end' may be undefined since the standard only requires
the pointer to one element past the last element of a container to be
well-defined.
