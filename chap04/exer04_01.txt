We noted in §4.2.3/65 that it is essential that the argument types in a call to
max match exactly. Will the following code work? If there is a problem, how
would you fix it?

    int maxlen;
    Student_info s;
    max(s.name.size(), maxlen);

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 65, it says that max's arguments must be of the same type.  On my
platform, trying to compile a program containing the above segment results in
the following compiler error:

    no matching function for call to
    ‘max(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char>::size_type, int&)’
    
There is another problem: neither maxlen nor s are explicitely initialized.  It
is not clear without further investigation what values, if any, these values
will be initialized to.

To fix the problems, simply change the first line of the code to

    std::string::size_type maxlen;

and presumably wait until both maxlen and s have been assigned meaningful values
before calling max().
