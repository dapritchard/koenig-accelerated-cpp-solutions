If the following code is legal, what can we infer about the return type of f?

    double d = f()[n];

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly, f() returns something for which the [ operator has meaning.  This could
either be a pointer or an object for which [ has been defined.

Secondly, the value of f()[n] must be something that can be converted to a type
double.  This could either be another type of number such as an int or float, or
an object for which a conversion to double has been defined.
