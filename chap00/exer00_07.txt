Is this a valid program?  Why or why not?

    #include <iostream>
    int main()
    {
        /* This is a comment that extends over serveral lines
           because it uses /* and */ as its starting and ending delimiters */
        std::cout << "Does this work?" << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not a valid program because the comment ends at the first */, and the
remaining terms on the line are not valid syntax.
