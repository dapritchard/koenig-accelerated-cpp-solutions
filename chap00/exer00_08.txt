Is this a valid program?  Why or why not?

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // This is a comment that extends over several lines
    // by using // at the beginning of each line instead of using /*
    // or */ to delimit comments.
    std::cout << "Does this work?" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, this is a valid program.  Everything to the right of // is commented out,
and the remaining syntax is valid.
