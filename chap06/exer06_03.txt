What does this program fragment do?

    vector<int> u(10, 100);
    vector<int> v;
    copy(u.begin(), u.end(), v.begin());
    
Write a program that contains this fragment, and compile and execute it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running this code on my system lead to a segmentation fault.  My guess is that
the vector object internally has a member pointer to the location in memory
where the data is to be stored, and since we haven't initialized it yet, it may
point anywhere in memory.  This could lead to `v.begin()' returning an address
that the program is not permitted to access (as determined by the OS), which
leads to the segmentation fault.

A second issue is that even if we have a location in memory for the data, the
vector has a size of 0, and copying data to that location could potentially
overwrite data that was allocated for other purposes.  Even if the data is
reserved for possible later use by the vector, the vector object still views
itself as having size 0 after the copy and consequently the normal vector
operations will not work as desired.
