Suppose we wish to find the median of a collection of values.  Assume that we
have read some of the values so far, and that we have no idea how many values
remain to be read.  Prove that we cannot afford to discard any of the values
that we have read.  Hint: One proof strategy is to assume that we can discard a
value, and then find values for the unread - and therefore unknown - part of our
collection that would cause the median to be the value that we discarded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose that we consider discarding the k-th largest value out of a total of n
values.  Let us call this value x.  Further suppose that we then read in (n - k)
values smaller then x and (k - 1) larger than x.  Then there are (n - 1) values
no greater than x and (n - 1) values no less than x, so it follows that x is the
median.  Thus we are unable to discard any values because there is always a set
of values that could cause the discarded value to be the median.
