The read_hw function section 4.1.3 page 57 solves a general problem (reading a
sequence of values into a vector) even though its name suggests that it should
be part of the implementation of Student_info.  Of course, we could change its
name - but suppose, instead, that you wanted to integrate it with the rest of
the Student_info code, in order to clarify that it was not intended for public
access despite its apparent generality?  How would you do so?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You could define it as a private function in the student_info namespace.
